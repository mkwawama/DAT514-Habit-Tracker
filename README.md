# DAT514-Habit-Tracker



## Instructions

This project is called ‘habit tracker’ where users can track their habits.  

In this project, users can add and choose a list of habits they want to complete.  

Users can choose from three priorities low, medium, and high. These priorities have values such as. High=15, Medium=10 and Low=5. 

The habit tracker will have tick boxes to check off when completed for each day. 

When a habit is completed the habit tracker will keep a score of your habits and calculate an average score for the week which will be shown on the right-hand side of the counter. 

The habit tracker will also have a graph to show the last seven days scores. 

Users can look back at the previous habits they completed through the calendar.
